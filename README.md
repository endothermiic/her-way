# HerWay
With more than half of women reporting that they feel unsafe while traveling at night, HerWay is a mapping application designed specifically to help women get home both quickly and safely. It was created in C++ using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) database with a graphical user interface (GUI) built with setups and callbacks from [GTK](https://docs.gtk.org/) and styled using the [EZGL](https://ug251.eecg.utoronto.ca/ece297s/ezgl_doc/index.html) library and traditional CSS.

Note: This map was created for Software Design and Communication (ECE297) at the University of Toronto. As such, all code is in a separate, private repository to avoid plagarism and is available upon request. A copy of the slides used for the final presentation is externally available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rBmUW8rLhqVlzK6LNSPRxFUlWmQcqsgYzBfIrxKKGQI/edit?usp=sharing) or within the repository as a pdf under `team028slides.pdf`.
